### State Bayes law {-}

Bayes law/theorem/rule states that

$$
  P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \: P(A)}{P(B)},
$$
where $P(X|Y)$ is the conditional probability of event X occuring given that Y is true. P(A) and P(B) are called marginal probabilities.

The law can be easily memorised and derived from the symmetric equation

$$
  P(A | B) \: P(B) = P(B | A)\: P(A).
$$
