### State Bayes law {-}

Bayes law/theorem/rule states that

$$
  P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \: P(A)}{P(B)},
$$
where $P(X|Y)$ is the conditional probability of event X occuring given that Y is true. P(A) and P(B) are called marginal probabilities.

The law can be easily memorised and derived from the symmetric equation

$$
  P(A | B) \: P(B) = P(B | A)\: P(A).
$$

### Explain what a p-value is in the context of an A/B test {-}

When performing an A/B test, our null hypothesis is that group B (the variant) is the same as group A (the control) based on some metric. The result of the experiment measures the difference in the value of the metric between the two groups.

p-value is the probability of observing such a difference or higher if the null hypothesis is true. In other words, if we did an A/A test instead of an A/B test, the probability of observing at least such an extreme result is this p-value.

### Explain what Type I and Type II errors are in the context of an A/B test {-}

Type I error is an error where we reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true. In an A/B test, this is an error where we conclude that we observed an effect in group B (variant) compared to group A (control), when the effect didn't really exist.

Type II error is an error where we fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false. In an A/B test, this is an error where we fail to observe an effect in group B (variant) compared to group A (control), when the effect did exist.
