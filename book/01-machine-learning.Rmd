#### How can you reduce overfitting? {-}

- Collect more data to train with
- Use data augmentation to generate more train data
- Use cross-validation to better estimate your error during model selection
- Reduce the complexity of the model by reducing the number of parameters/layers
- Use a different model/architecture that generalises better
- Use a regularisation technique (L1/L2 regularisation, dropout)
- Use early stopping during training
- Filter out irrelevant or redundant features using a feature selection technique
- Use Ensembling to combine predictions from multiple models
